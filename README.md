1. How to Find Your Wi-Fi Password on Windows
If your Windows device is already connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can retrieve the password saved on your system.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Open Network & Internet Settings:

Click on the Start menu, type Control Panel, and open it.
Go to Network and Sharing Center.
View Your Active Connection:

Under "Network and Sharing Center," find the network you are connected to. Click on the Wi-Fi connection next to "Connections."
Open Wireless Properties:

In the Wi-Fi Status window, click on Wireless Properties.
Navigate to the Security tab.
Show the Password:

Check the box labeled Show characters. This will display the Wi-Fi password in the Network security key field.
2. Finding Wi-Fi Password on macOS
If you are using a Mac and want to find a Wi-Fi password, you can retrieve it using the Keychain Access app, which stores your Wi-Fi passwords and other secure information.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Open Keychain Access:

Open Finder and go to the Applications folder. Then, go to the Utilities folder and open Keychain Access.
Search for Your Wi-Fi Network:

In the search bar at the top right, type the name of your Wi-Fi network (SSID). This will filter the results.
View Password:

Double-click on your network name in the results. A window will pop up with information about your network.
Check the box next to Show password.
Enter your Mac's administrator username and password when prompted to reveal the saved Wi-Fi password.
3. Finding Wi-Fi Password on Android
On Android, retrieving the Wi-Fi password can be a bit tricky, especially if you do not have root access. However, for devices running Android 10 or newer, there is a built-in feature to share Wi-Fi credentials via a QR code.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Android 10 and Newer:
Open Wi-Fi Settings:

Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Wi-Fi.
Access Your Current Connection:

Tap on the Wi-Fi network you're connected to.
Share Wi-Fi Password:

Tap on Share. You may be asked to authenticate with your PIN, password, or fingerprint.
A QR code will appear on the screen. You can scan this QR code with another device to automatically join the network.
Under the QR code, the password will also be displayed in plain text.
Older Versions of Android:
For older versions of Android, you may need to use a third-party app (such as WiFi Password Show, available on the Google Play Store) or root your device to access the saved Wi-Fi passwords.

4. Finding Wi-Fi Password on iOS
Unfortunately, iOS does not provide a built-in option to view saved Wi-Fi passwords directly. However, you can access Wi-Fi passwords on an iOS device if you have a Mac, provided that your devices are connected to the same Apple ID and iCloud Keychain is enabled.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Using iCloud Keychain:
Ensure iCloud Keychain Is Enabled:
On your iPhone, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Keychain, and ensure it's turned on.
Use Keychain Access on Mac:
Open Keychain Access on your Mac (located in Applications > Utilities).
Search for your Wi-Fi network name and follow the same steps as outlined for macOS to reveal the password.
5. Finding Wi-Fi Password from the Router
If you are unable to recover the Wi-Fi password from your device, you can access it directly from the router’s settings page. This method is particularly useful if you are the network administrator.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Access Router Settings:

Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address into the address bar. Common IP addresses for routers include:
192.168.1.1
192.168.0.1
10.0.0.1
The IP address can usually be found on a sticker on your router.
Log in to the Router:

You’ll need to enter the router’s username and password. If you haven’t changed these, the default login credentials can also be found on the router’s sticker or in the user manual.
Find the Wi-Fi Settings:

Once logged in, look for the Wi-Fi settings section. This could be listed under Wireless, Wi-Fi Settings, or Network Settings.
View or Change the Password:

In the Wi-Fi settings section, you should be able to see the network name (SSID) and password. You can either view the current password or change it to something new.
6. Using Third-Party Tools to Recover Wi-Fi Password
There are also third-party tools available that can help you recover a Wi-Fi password, especially if it’s stored on your computer. Some common tools include:

WirelessKeyView (for Windows): This free tool allows you to view Wi-Fi passwords saved on your Windows computer.
WiFi Passwords Recover (for Windows): This tool works similarly to WirelessKeyView and can retrieve saved passwords.
MacPass (for macOS): This tool can help manage passwords, including Wi-Fi passwords, in an encrypted database.
7. Security Considerations
Change Password Regularly: It’s a good practice to change your Wi-Fi password periodically, especially if you suspect that unauthorized users may have access to your network.
Use Strong Passwords: Choose a strong password with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to make it difficult for others to guess or crack.
Enable Encryption: Ensure that your Wi-Fi is encrypted using WPA2 or WPA3 encryption to protect your data from being intercepted by attackers.
8. Preventing Unauthorized Access
To keep your Wi-Fi network secure, you can:

Use a Guest Network: Set up a separate guest network for visitors to prevent unauthorized access to your primary network.
Disable WPS: Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature that makes it easy to connect devices to your Wi-Fi network, but it can also be vulnerable to attacks. Disable it if you’re concerned about security.
Limit DHCP Leases: You can limit the number of devices that can connect to your network by configuring the DHCP settings on your router.
Conclusion
Finding your Wi-Fi password is possible through several methods depending on the platform or device you're using. Whether you're on a Windows PC, a Mac, an Android phone, or even a router, there are straightforward ways to recover your credentials. However, always prioritize network security by using strong passwords and keeping your router's firmware up to date.
